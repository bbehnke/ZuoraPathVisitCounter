Zuora interview preliminary java test

Author: Bradley Behnke

Prompt: 
Given a dataset that represents a user's navigation of a website, find the top N most frequently visited paths.

Project source code: 
https://github.com/bbehnke/ZuoraPathVisitCounter

Preface: 
This project will fulfill the given prompt. The code which fulfills the prompt is found in the UserNavigationUtil class.
I also included a simple user data file parser and an application which utilizes the code from the prompt and the file
parser to output meaningful results. N, from the prompt, is represented by resultSize. Overall I feel good about the
implementation code, but the testing is not comprehensive.

Source code notes:
This project is a maven project and can be built/tested/installed with the standard maven commands.

Jar command line expectation:
java -jar zuora-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <resultSize> <pathSize> <path> <delimiter(optional)>


Jar command line example:
java -jar zuora-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 5 3 /Users/admin/Documents/Zuora/userdata.txt
